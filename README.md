# OPEN-JJBA

An open source JJBA game.

## About

Open JJBA is written in [Typescript (via Roblox-TS)](https://roblox-ts.com) and uses the [Matter](https://eryn.io/matter/docs/intro/) library. Before contributing code, it is good to get familiar with both.

## Licensing

The project itself uses [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) to specify the used licenses. More information (including the copyright holders) can be found in the individual files.
A significant portion of the source code and assets are licensed under `GPL-3.0-or-later`. The exception is code that may be used as an example, for instance [hooks](src/shared/hooks), which are licensed under `MIT`. Project files are generally licensed under `CC0-1.0`.
